Makefile:

1. enter "make" to compile the program

2. enter "./race_simulation" to Run the Program



Input:
horses: Number of horses greater than or equal to 2 (integer).
trackL: Length of track. An integer greater than or equal to 2.

Steps:
Defines a horse class with name and position
Define track class with methods to manage the race track length and print the current track with all horse positions.
Simulate function takes two arguments: horses (number of horses) and trackL (track length). Then create an array of horse objects with names.
Then the function enters a while loop where a random horse is chosen to move.
After every move, current state of the track is printed.
If the horse that just moved is at the end then the winning statement is printed and it exits the while loop.


Output:
User interface.
Displays the current state of the track after each move.
When a horse reaches the end of the track, it announces the winner.
